# Code-Samples

Code samples from various projects, both personal and professional.

Word Lineage is my current project, a small WPF / .NET 6 app for storing words and their relationships to one another.  It is primarily scripted in C# and XAML.

Hidden Harmony is an casual experimental game about making music and bringing the world back to life.  My primary roles were as a lead artist and a technical artist.  Included are a few examples of shaders written to create special effects on some of our creatures, as well as the controller for an in-world music visualizer made out of foliage.  Primary languages included are C# and HLSL.
